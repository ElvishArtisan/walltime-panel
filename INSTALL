BUILDING WINDOWS BINARIES
-------------------------
The build system for walltime-panel uses the MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows)
environment for building Windows binaries, available at http://www.mingw.org/.
It is also possible to build such binaries on CentOS 7 using the MinGW
cross-compiler packages (available in EPEL). The following environmental
variables need to be configured in the MinGW colnfiguration on CentOS 7:
